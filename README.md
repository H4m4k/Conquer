# Conquer

This is my first training project to learn HTML/CSS. It does not include HTML5 semantics, as I have decided to not make things harder and learn step by step.
According to plan the goal was to create a working website and so I did. 
Conquer helped me learn the basics of using HTML and CSS with true experience of problems encountered and ways of solving them.
It was the first time I have truly experienced the beauty of WebDev and how it can also be a pain.
